## Placing Map Notes

Sometimes you'll want to mark locations of interest that may not be part of the official dataset. A point of interest you want to come back to, a place with good loot, whatever it is.

**RightClick** on the place you want to place the map note and use the Sidebar to enter some text. The first line will be used as a label for the marker.
