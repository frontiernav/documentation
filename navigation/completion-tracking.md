# Completion Tracking

To help keep track of entities you've already found, you can mark them as "Complete" using various interfaces like the Sidebar and Context Menu.

### Resetting Completed Entities

If you want to re-play a game and clear all of your completed entities, you can do so from [Game Preferences](game-preferences.md).
