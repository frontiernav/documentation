# Navigation Bar

The strip of icons along the left side of every page is called the Navigation Bar. It allows you to access common pages where ever you are on the website.

The Navigation Bar is contextual. When you're within a game context, it'll show navigation for that game. If you haven't chosen a game, it'll show global navigation.

### User Drawer

Clicking on your Avatar in the Navigation Bar will open up the User Drawer. This lets you access various pages specific to you such as your Profile, Settings and if you've chosen a game, [Game Preferences](game-preferences.md). Like with the Navigation Bar, it is also contextual and changes based on whether you have chosen a game or not.
