# Adding Games

All of FrontierNav's games are stored in its own data tables. You can add a game just like editing any other data. However, you'll need to wait for your Change Request to be accepted before you can start adding data to the game itself.

Before adding a game, you might want to ask an Admin about it to see if it will be accepted. There are a lot of games out there and right now FrontierNav's choice of games is limited to those the Admins are interested in maintaining in the long run.

To get started, take a look at [FrontierNav's Game Table](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/frontiernav/visualisations/tables/types/Game).
