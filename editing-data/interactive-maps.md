# Editing Interactive Maps

## Presentation

Maps are organised as follows:

* Maps represent other Entities like Areas and Regions.
* Map Tiles and Map Images represent Maps. Maps can have multiple Map Tiles.
* Maps contain Map Features, such as points on the map.
* Map Features indicate the location of specific Entities, their target.

## Creating Map Features

**RightClick** anywhere on a Map to place a Map Marker. From there, you can create a Map Feature and choose an Entity to target.

## Legacy Maps

The maps for Xenoblade X, do not support editing from the Maps view. These will be migrated to the editable Maps eventually.
